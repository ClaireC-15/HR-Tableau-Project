## About the project
This project is a step-by-step learning experience in building dashboard projects using Tableau which I replicated from 
Data with Baraa Youtube channel. You can find the link of the youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcGF09Awm4Y).

## About the dataset
The data used in this HR Dashboard project is generated using a combination of ChatGPT prompts and the Python Faker library. This dataset simulates a set of employee information typically found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data. The generated data is designed to mimic real-world HR data, providing a rich dataset for analysis and visualization in Tableau.
